# System of linear equations solver on C++

Lab work for a university course in my third year (2020).

Methods used in this lab:

1. Jacobi method.
2. Seidel method.
3. Simple iteration method.
4. Relaxation method.
5. Relaxation method for 3-diagonal matrices.

There are ready settings files in the folder, change them however you want.
Relaxation method for 3-diagonal matrices is not included in the settings files, diagonals are set manually inside the .cpp file.
